class ReverseLookup:
    """
    This class is designed to perform reverse DNS lookup for all hosts in a specified subnet.
    It uses the thread pool executor from Python's concurrent.futures module, which allows it to parallelize the name resolution process.

    Attributes:
        subnet (str): The IP address of the network.
        mask (int): The netmask for the subnet.

    Methods:
        lookup(host) -> str: This method attempts to resolve an IP address into a hostname using socket.gethostbyaddr() function. If resolution fails, it logs a warning message and returns 'NA'.
        run() -> dict[str, str]: This method generates an IPv4Network object from the subnet and mask provided during initialization of this class instance. It then loops over all hosts in that network (excluding the last octet with value 255 as it is reserved for broadcast purposes), submits each host to a thread pool executor which calls lookup() method, collects all futures into a dictionary where keys are IP addresses and values are futures objects returned by executor.submit() function. Finally, this method returns a new dictionary where keys are the same as in the original one but values are results of the futures obtained through the .result() method.
